This is an interactive global [shallow fluid model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) based on [Ringler and Randall's 2001 paper](http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/BUGS/pdf/conservation.pdf) and implemented on the [Unity engine](http://unity3d.com/). 

The live version is [here](http://andyljones.com/shallow-fluid-model/), which you'll need the Unity3D browser plugin to run.
